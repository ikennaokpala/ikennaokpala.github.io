"Apache Wicket" is the simplest to use java front end framework available on the web.




For the following reasons:




- Wicket encourages total separation between plain Java code and  HTML, with the help of meaningful abstractions.  (i.e. allows the java code to handle all the logic)


<!--more-->


- Wicket provides excellent support and management of server side state transparently.




- Very little XML configuration is required to get your web application going. this is not the case when compared to some other frameworks that are largely dependent on XML config kind of files.




- And finally, it does not have any special mark up that you would have to learn afresh (i.e. just HTML tags are marked with a simple  and very unnoticeable “wicket:id” tag, and you are done).
