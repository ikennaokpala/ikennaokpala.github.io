Annotation is the method of associating the program elements with the meta tags so that the compiler can extract program behavior to support the annotated elements to generate interdependent code when necessary.

The  objective behind annotations is to make the development ("i.e. coding")  process easier.

Annotations behaves like the meta. The literal meaning of meta data is data about data. Java also signifies this meaning. Annotations are like meta data, means you are free to add your code and can also apply them to variables, parameters, fields type declarations, methods and constructors.

Metadata is also used to create the documentation to perform rudimentary compile time checking and even for tracking down the dependencies in code.

XDoclet contains all these features and is widely used.

Annotations provide a means of indicating about methods, classes, dependencies, incompleteness and also about the references on other methods and classes respectively. Quoting from Sun's official site, "It (annotation-based development) lets us avoid writing boilerplate code under many circumstances by enabling tools to generate it from annotations in the source code. This leads to a declarative programming style where the programmer says what should be done and tools emit the code to do it."
