Been practicing BDD using the usual suspects like RSpec and Cucumber for user stories in conjunction with stakeholders, to reveal and document behavior, as well as drive development in a large legacy code base.

I was asked this question yesterday at a meetup.

> What is the difference between a good User story and a bad one?



From my end based on experience and reading literature i summarise thus:




  * A good user story should be short and sweet;  A bad one is nothing short of being bulky and clunky.


  * A good user story should focus on the "WHAT" and not the "HOW";  A bad one may try to capture the "WHAT" and "HOW".


  * A good user story should reflect the vision of the product owner; A bad one would not.


  * A good user story should be broken down properly (questionable and able to drive conversations); A bad one would be obscure and unable to drive curiosity.


  * A good user story should paint the picture properly for the Software Engineers (who may not have domain knowledge at first) but are expected to deliver value;  A bad one will paint a totally different picture.
