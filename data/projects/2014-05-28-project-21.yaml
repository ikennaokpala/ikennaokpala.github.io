description: "This project involved creating the a REST API a wordpress based database. This was required in order to allow other devices (i.e mobile tablets) and apps gain access to data and services from the website.<br/><br/>

Ikenna worked solely on this project. He designed and developed the REST API resources, endpoints and abstractions. The entire codebase is based on Go/Golang (i.e sqlx, Negroni, httprouter, render, context etc) and swagger UI for API documentation.<br/><br/>

This API is used to access content and formats from globalfoodbook's wordpress database. This API provides a programmatic access to content, formats and meta data from the wordpress database. With this REST API, developers can include data from Global Food Book in apps or websites.<br/><br/>

Used docker to setup(i.e development and production) environment and integrate other micro-services like the nutriition facts and SEO services. "
