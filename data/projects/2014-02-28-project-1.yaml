description: "Modern Stock Take (MST) is an operation which performs a stocktake in each large format store twice per year. The aim of this operation is to correct any inaccuracies in the stock records of these stores in order to drive an improvement in availability.<br/>This project was developed on within the clientâ€™s premises, I wrote the code for this project independently in collaboaration with the product owners, and I was also as part of a larger scrum team composed of other developers working on other projects. <br/>

The development was done and scheduled in an iterative manner with multiple feedback loops to ensure full involvement and collaboration.<br/>

Focused on the results delivering the requirements.<br/>

This app uses BackboneJS/Underscore/JQuery for frontend app model structure, rendering and DOM manipulation.<br/>

The backend was RUBY/RAILS REST based API, databases (MySQL and Teradata). This app also includes multi database connection to Teradata and MySQL as well as import scripts from Teradata to the mysql tables via fast exports and also BTEQ transactions as well."
