description: "This is an information facility that helps users find and/or locate the nearest court that offers the services they require. <br/><br/> Ikenna worked as part of the information services team at MOJ. He worked on two ruby on rails government open source projects (courtfinder and tribunal decision).<br/><br/> His work ranged from bug fixes, addition of new features and a bit of devops.<br/><br/>
Here is  <a href='https://github.com/ministryofjustice/courtfinder/graphs/contributors' target='_blank'>  a link </a> to the projects source repository on Github. <br/><br/>NB: The commits I made here are indicative and have since reduced due to removal of the SSH key (for the computer I used at the time) from my github account."
