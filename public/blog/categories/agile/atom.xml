    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bumped into this <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/agilecommons/commonsblog/~3/iFH4_vtYCMA/using-economics-prioritize-your-backlog">article</a> by Alex Pukinskis and it got me thinking.</p>

<p>This could be another great way to help translate/eradicate subjective connotations to actual value propositions.</p>

<p>But then I don't know what kind of business emotions this may stir up.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Also, would this be another opportunity to emphasize on the already obvious (these days everyone is aware of certain economic trends/indicators) or will it be based on what could be a potential viral revenue stream (the next BIG thing).</p>

<p>And how well could the team understand and/or benefit from this together????</p>

<p>Alex's article, advocates the use of adequeate job sizing practice with actual cost implications, value scoring and a couple of other latent metrics brought in, to serve as visibility into feasibility.</p>

<p>According to Don Reinertsen decision could be initially reached through calculating economic models, which he termed a Weighted Shortest-Job-First (WSJF) approach.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ceteris paribus</em></strong>, it is expected that the smallest of features will deliver value quickly and should take precendence at the start of the development efforts.</p>

<p>All good and fine..</p>

<p>On the flip side, the likes of Ron Sen would argue that in this present day information rules and I qoute:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Realistically, forces affecting price (and psychology) constantly evolve, under a variety of influences. What has changed during the information age, however, is the transmission velocity. Therefore, volatility can theoretically increase (or decrease) in response to information. Much of what passes for news or commentary has the design to alter opinion or 'spin' facts."</p></blockquote>

<p>This area of estimating software project is quite susceptible to a lot of news hazard and could take a sharp turn, if not crash land somewhere.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, it is gaining popularity and it appears some projects have found value in this approach. Before I forget it sounds great on paper.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Been practicing BDD using the usual suspects like RSpec and Cucumber for user stories in conjunction with stakeholders, to reveal and document behavior, as well as drive development in a large legacy code base.</p>

<p>I was asked this question yesterday at a meetup.</p>

<!--more-->


<blockquote><p>What is the difference between a good User story and a bad one?</p></blockquote>

<p>From my end based on experience and reading literature i summarise thus:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A good user story should be short and sweet;  A bad one is nothing short of being bulky and clunky.</p></li>
<li><p>A good user story should focus on the "WHAT" and not the "HOW";  A bad one may try to capture the "WHAT" and "HOW".</p></li>
<li><p>A good user story should reflect the vision of the product owner; A bad one would not.</p></li>
<li><p>A good user story should be broken down properly (questionable and able to drive conversations); A bad one would be obscure and unable to drive curiosity.</p></li>
<li><p>A good user story should paint the picture properly for the Software Engineers (who may not have domain knowledge at first) but are expected to deliver value;  A bad one will paint a totally different picture.</p></li>
</ul>
