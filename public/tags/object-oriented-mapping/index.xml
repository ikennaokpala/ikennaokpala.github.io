      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I gave a talk on ORMs in Golang at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/&#34;&gt;London Golang Meetup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who turned up and for those who could not make it, here is the video link &lt;a href=&#34;https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6162-orms-with-golang&#34;&gt;https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6162-orms-with-golang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my talk by defining what Object Relational Mapping is with a slight detour on its brief history thus far (mostly from what I have witnessed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went on to talk about WHY? ORMs are important and HOW? useful they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued with some insights on Go&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, well from a newbie&amp;rsquo;s perspective (I am only just a few weeks into practical Golang coding, counting by nights).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to this, I had some earlier introduction to Golang from &lt;a href=&#34;http://micrypt.com/&#34; title=&#34;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&#34;&gt;Seyi Ogunyemi&lt;/a&gt; from our &lt;a href=&#34;http://freeair.io/2012/08/22/Go-Lang-Chat-Free-Style-with-Seyi-Ogunyemi.html&#34; title=&#34;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&#34;&gt;podcast episode on Golang&lt;/a&gt; and after a few years later had a chat with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dahernan&#34; title=&#34;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&#34;&gt;David Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys for sharing your knowledge with me and BigUps to Seyi for reviewing my slides for this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async class=&#34;speakerdeck-embed&#34; data-id=&#34;e23220596c5a4ae39a04323121eeacf2&#34; data-ratio=&#34;1.77777777777778&#34; src=&#34;//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the experiences I shared in this talk where base on a small REST API (v1) I built with Golang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea with this REST API, is to trim down a somewhat monolithic wordpress database to the bare essentials and enough to cater for a mobile et al.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are the opportunity to try Go out, yay!!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be probably be posting progress as I continue to progress the REST API (v2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my friends (Wendy, Nick, Paul, et al) at Skills Matter for making it possible that this talk was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
