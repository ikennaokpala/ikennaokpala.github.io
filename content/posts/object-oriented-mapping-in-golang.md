Today, I will be giving a talk ORMs in Golang.

In this talk I define what ORMs are with a detour on brief history of ORMs.

Then on talked about WHY? ORMs are important and HOW? useful they can be.

I continued with some insights on Go philosophy, well from a newbie's perspective (at the time just a few weeks of golang coding, counting by nights).

Prior to this, I had some earlier introduction to Golang from [Seyi Ogunyemi](http://micrypt.com/) from our [podcast episode on Golang](http://freeair.io/2012/08/22/Go-Lang-Chat-Free-Style-with-Seyi-Ogunyemi.html) and after a few years later had a chat with [David Hernandez](https://github.com/dahernan) as well.

Thanks guys for help me out and reviewing my slides for this talk.

Some of the experiences I shared in this talk where base on a small REST API (v1) I built with Golang.

The idea with this REST API, is to trim down a somewhat monolithic wordpress database to the bare essentials and enough to cater for a mobile et al.

So here we are the opportunity to try Go out, yay!!.

I will be probably be posting progress as I continue to progress the REST API (v2).

Thanks to my friends (Wendy, Nick, Paul, et al) at Skills Matter for making it possible that this talk was recorded.
