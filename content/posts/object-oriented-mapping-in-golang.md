Today, I gave a talk on ORMs in Golang at the [London Golang Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/).

Thanks to everyone who turned up and for those who could not make it, here is the video link https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6162-orms-with-golang.

I started my talk by defining what Object Relational Mapping is with a slight detour on its brief history thus far (mostly from what I have witnessed).

Then I went on to talk about WHY? ORMs are important and HOW? useful they are.

I continued with some insights on Go's philosophy, well from a newbie's perspective (I am only just a few weeks into practical Golang coding, counting by nights).

Prior to this, I had some earlier introduction to Golang from [Seyi Ogunyemi](http://micrypt.com/ "" target="_blank") from our [podcast episode on Golang](http://freeair.io/2012/08/22/Go-Lang-Chat-Free-Style-with-Seyi-Ogunyemi.html "" target="_blank") and after a few years later had a chat with [David Hernandez](https://github.com/dahernan "" target="_blank") as well.

Thanks guys for sharing your knowledge with me and BigUps to Seyi for reviewing my slides for this talk.

Some of the experiences I shared in this talk were based on a small REST API (v1) I built with Golang.

The idea with this REST API is to trim down a somewhat monolithic wordpress database to the bare essentials and enough to cater for a mobile/tablet apps et al.

So here it is, an opportunity to give Golang a go, yay!!.

I will be probably be posting progress as I continue to progress the REST API (v2).

Thanks to my friends (Wendy, Nick, Paul, et al) at Skills Matter for making it possible that this talk was recorded.
