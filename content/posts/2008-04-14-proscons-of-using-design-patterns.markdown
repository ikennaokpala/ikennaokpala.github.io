Pros.

* Quality, Flexibility and Re-Use
Design Patterns capture solutions to common computing problems and represent the time, effort and experience gained from applying these solutions over numerous domains/iterations. Generally systems that use Design Patterns are elegant, flexible and have more potential for reuse.

* Provide a common frame of reference for discussion of designs

<!--more-->

* Patterns can be combined to solve one or more common computing problems

* Provide a common format for pattern specification Intent, Motivation, Applicability, Structure, Participants, Collaborations, Consequences

Cons.

* Complexity. Design Patterns require a reasonable degree of study and can be difficult for some designers to grasp. Junior designers/developers may not have encountered Design Patterns and have to learn them before they can be productive on a project.
