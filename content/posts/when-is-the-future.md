# When is the future

In my early years, I conceived the future as a distant state along the dimension of time waiting to happen; but as I grew up I got to learn that such a view of the future is not only naive, but ironically, unrealistic. Even though the literary perception of futuristic concepts suggests the above, it is flayed in the fact that it is practically unreal.

The future is now. Today was the future of yesterday. This moment was the future a nanosecond ago. This view has helped me gain some control of my lifeâ€™s direction based on the underlying principle of cause and effect. Since this realization, I have treated every futuristic phenomenon from the perspective of the network of causes, events, reactions and effects.
