if you run into this error


{% highlight bash %}

=====================================================================
Vagrant experienced an error!

Vagrant could not detect VirtualBox! Make sure VirtualBox is properly installed.
If VirtualBox is installed, it may be an incorrect version. Vagrant currently
requires VirtualBox 3.2.x. Please install the proper version to continue.
=====================================================================
{% endhighlight %}

Know ye! that you may be using an older version of vagrant...

Solution is to do gem install vagrant -v='0.8.8' or edit your Gemfile to include gem 'vagrant', '=0.8.8'

hope that helps..
