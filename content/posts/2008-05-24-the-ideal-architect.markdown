“The ideal architect should be a person of letters, a mathematician, familiar with historical studies, a diligent student of philosophy, acquainted with music, not ignorant of medicine, learned in the responses of jurisconsults, familiar with astronomy and astronomical calculations.”
—Vitruvius, circa 25 BC
<!--more-->

Vitruvius was not referring to a software architect, but the basic idea is that the architect should have the following characteristics. An architect should be a person who is well-rounded, mature, experienced, educated, learns quickly, a leader, communicates well and can make the difficult decision when necessary.

For architects to be well-rounded, they must have a working knowledge of the business or problem domain. They can gain this knowledge through experience or education.

In addition, architects must have a broad knowledge of technology. An architect might have first-hand experience with a particular technology, but they must have at least a general understanding of competing technologies to make informed decisions about which technology can work best.

A good architect evaluates all possible solutions to a problem regardless of the technology being used.
