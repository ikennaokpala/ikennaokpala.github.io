Recently, i came across my lecture note which covered rules that make a web site design excellent, this was a lecture given by Mr. Denver Reynolds.

It states clearly that >>>>>


  * Content is king: Users would visit a site for information. Without information the raison dâ€™etre of the site is non-existent.
  * User orientated design: If the site design is not focused around the user and facilitating their ease of use the site can appear cumbersome and awkward to use.
  * Low click depth: Every part of the site should be accessible in just a few clicks of the mouse (ideally 3 or less). This makes the site easy to navigate and find information for the users.

<!--more-->

  * 6 second rule: The web page should have loaded into the browser within 6 seconds. This is generally the maximum amount of time a visitor would invest in the site without receiving any return in the form of information.
  * Page consistency: The page design should appear consistent and coherent, thus signifying the site as a unified whole      etc.
