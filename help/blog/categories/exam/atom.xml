    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone ,</p>

<p>i passed SCBCD 5.0 with 96 %</p>

<p>I used basically the following materials:</p>

<p>O'reilly Enterprise Java Beans 3.0 (extensively used it).</p>

<p>Mastering EJB 3.0 (Partially).</p>

<p>EJB 3.0 Specs (Partially).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>SCBCD 5.0 Study Guide by Mikalai Zaikin (extensively used it)As for experience,i would say have got much of the thoery type in EJB 3.0, so found it quite hard in the exam proper.</p>

<p>I even think i failed the drag and drop questions " Well may be ".</p>

<p>Feel free to use the MOCK QUESTIONS on this Blog they were package by me during my prepararion for the exam. (CHECK BLOG ARCHIVE TO NAVIGATE TO THE MOCK QUESTIONS)</p>

<p>i Strongly recommend you using the Mock Question with the EJB 3.0 Specs final release follow it question by question with critism in mind please.</p>

<p>i would love and appreciate your comments, views and other suggests.</p>
